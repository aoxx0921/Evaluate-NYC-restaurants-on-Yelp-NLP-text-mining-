       "'This place was really nice. Let\\'s start with the food. If your not sure what to order, ?appetizers must try there Toro Tartare, Bone Marrow, & wagyu Beef Carpaccio. We also ordered their Chelsea Market oysters which is common. Nice and fresh. For your main entree must try their Sea Urchin Uni, Scallop and Hotate Otoro Nigiri & their Duck Duck Goose! For dessert we got the Lava Bomb and the Matcha. They make really good martinis of which I ordered the Lychee Martini. Great wine selection as well and beer Asahi. I know this all seems a lot but it is worth it for a night out in a fancy restaurant There service was great. Every dish was introduced upon serving & you were always served with a fresh clean plate. The ambience is great. U are able to hear each other with out having to worry about music being to loud. Great for a date or business dinner meeting or just a night out with friends to socialize.I had high hopes going here after looking at the menu. It was definitely pricey but figured with a head chef like Morimoto it would be worth it. I was sadly disappointed. The food was not worth the money. We ordered the shisito peppers (a seasonal special), wagyu beef skewers, and chicken ramen for appetizers. The shisito peppers were underwhelming and not seasoned well. The wagyu skewers were very good, with a nice char taste, and the beef as tender as ever. When a dish is described as \"iron chef chicken noodle soup\" I would expect something pretty spectacular - it was not. It was just super salty broth, noodles, and 3, yes 3, little pieces of chicken. I ordered a sushi roll for my entree and my fianc¨¦ ordered the chicken roulade dish. My sushi roll was just a sushi roll, nothing special. The chicken roulade was probably the best dish out of everything; presented nicely with large slices of black truffle scattered throughout the dish. The service overall was not that great. We waited a good 40 min for our main course to come out and our waitress would disappear for 15/20 min at a time throughout the night. Overall just a really disappointing experience.Visited October 2017 for date night with my husband. Great sushi, so fresh and taste combinations are great, service was great too and the Waiter was very professional. Recommend !Came here with a reservation for a Wednesday lunch during restaurant week. My friend and I were seated immediately and given excellent service. She ordered the short rib, while I had the sushi combo. This was from a restaurant week special menu ($29). Our mains were served with green salad and miso soup. Both were delicious. My sushi was very fresh. The desserts that came after were fine. They were presented nicely, but nothing special. The ambience and service here were superb. Will come back another time to try the full menu.Ambience was really nice, however they sat us down at a small table with another couple on Valentines Day that seemed a bit weird & it looked like we were intruding their dinner since it was such a small table that only fit 4-6 people. Overall the food was pretty good & fresh. We started off with the toro tartare which had good presentation and liked the variety of toppings. The smoked king salmon, eel avocado & fatty tuna pieces were also very delicious! I also had the sea bass that had a good flavor to it, although cooked more than I would have liked it to be and had a chewy yet harder than usual texture (seemed a little over cooked). I would come back to do the tasting menu next time.I\\'ve had a great experience here in the past. The food and service was great the first time I came. However, my Valentine\\'s Day experience was terrible. The service and food was subpar. We were seated next to a ratchet couple who kept using flash photography, they had their camera flashlights on trying to record the food. They also played videos on their phone with the volume on loudspeaker. The food was subpar and was lacking in quality compared to the first time we were here. The dessert I ordered was horrendous. I took one bite of it and grabbed the check. I couldn\\'t leave the door faster.Note: The waitstaff do not clean the table after a party has left. They only lightly brush crumbs away and wipe once. Eating utensils are also placed directly onto the table. Ew.. gross!Great service and fresh food, nothing special and not bad as well. You could take a rest here after your shopping because it\\'s just next door to the Chelsea Market, very convenient.We came here for restaurant week. The ambiance and decor was on point, modern, sleekand smart. I like how they used glass as dividers so you feel semi-private yet the restaurant is still very airy and spacious. Food wise they only have lunch restaurant week, which consist of a bento box style tray and a desert. I got 10piece sashimi, which was good but not wow. The desert was outstanding though. I got the passion fruit sorbet, cream with sesame flakes. It was creative yet well balanced. Lastly we also got their signature toro sashimi appetizer. It came with 6different dips and each one of them is a good complimentary to the toro or in combination. Overall it was a pleasant meal, I would like to try other options of the main course next time around.I\\'ve been wanting to try Morimoto for a long time now, and I\\'m so glad I finally got the chance to for NYC Restaurant Week 2018 Winter Edition. My friend and I both had some issues finding the restaurant as Google Maps shows that it is located inside Chelsea Market; in reality, it is in the same warehouse as Chelsea Market but it has its own entrance. Luckily I called the restaurant and they picked up right away and were able to direct us to the location of the restaurant. I was really impressed by the decor of the restaurant. Part of the decoration includes a lit wall made from clear glass bottles which really gives the restaurant a classy, fine dining look to it. And this is a bit of an odd thing to comment on, but I really liked the chopsticks they gave us? They were clear hard plastic but not too weighty, and once again, they just looked and felt so classy. Our server was very attentive and courteous in explaining everything on the menu and if we needed anything, he was always around to help us without us having to wait too long. For restaurant week, you can order a set which comes with salad, miso soup, and cucumber pickles and finally a dessert. I ordered the sashimi set which came with 10 pieces of chef\\'s selection sushi. Omakase in the city usually costs a pretty penny, but for $29, I was able to get omakase, plus a salad, soup, cucumber pickles, and a dessert - ie not bad!The sashimi set was good, but I don\\'t think the sashimi pieces I received were anything unique or special. I was disappointed to not see salmon in the set (I know I said I was looking for unique sashimi pieces, but come on, salmon is a staple!) I was however, impressed by the dessert I ordered. I ordered the shiro choko, which is a dessert made of white chocolate cream, passion yuzu sorbet, marble meringue and sesame chocolate soil. Not only was it a very pretty dish, it tasted amazing too! It was packed full of flavor and surprisingly, none of the flavors clashed with each other. I also liked the different textures in the dish from the creamy sorbet to the crunch of the sesame chocolate soil. It was a refreshing and light dessert and the perfect way to conclude our service. I had a pleasant experience at Morimoto, and I would definitely like to come back again in the future!I came here with my daughter for lunch as it was participating in restaurant week. The place is very pretty. Sort of sparse and sleek but pleasing to the eye. I ordered the angry chicken. My daughter got the chef\\'s choice sashimi. The tray with the food came out within seconds of our order. Very strange but ok. The tray contained miso soup, very tasty, a simple seaweed salad, sticky rice, cucumber and green bean sides and the chicken entree. The angry chicken was a bit spicy but delicious. Our desserts came. I ordered the soba parfait.... what can I say about buckwheat disguised as a parfait... only that it\\'s not something I\\'d want to try again. All in all I thought the meal was above average but not special.I came here with my friend for restaurant week and got an angry chicken and braised cod. The cod was delicious but the chicken was raw... They comped us for the chicken by overall the quality of the food was not worth the price. Not a great experience but the server Dina was very sweet and helpful.Last year I had a 5 star experience and couldn\\'t wait to return. ?This year for restaurant week I ordered the braised black cod. ?The cod did not taste fresh, and it was covered in too much ginger soy reduction. ?Was this an attempt to mask the cod? I don\\'t know. ?One of the sides was miso soup. It arrived luke warm and had to be returned. ?Dessert was soba hana, which was good, but the decadent molten lava cake I had last year was not offered.It can sometimes be a rapid descent down the mountain.We came here for lunch during restaurant week and was treated to an excellent meal. First of, the location is right next to Chelsea Market which makes the area busy but definitely puts you in the right mood to experience a good lunch or dinner.Service upon entry was very good with someone checking us in and another taking our coats almost immediately despite being very busy at the time. The area is elegantly decorated with a modern flair with a bright, crystalline theme. We also noticed how the tables are separated with a thick glass divider which helped give a measure of privacy during your meal while still feeling connected to the ambience of the rest of the restaurant. Our server was fast, attentive but not at all intrusive.On to the important stuff though - the food! We ordered the Braised Black Cod, and the Sashimi, with the Wagyu Carpaccio as an appetizer. Finished it off with the Shiro Choko for dessert. The star of the show was definitely the Wagyu Carpaccio. It was extremely tender, very flavorful, beautifully marinated but not overwhelmingly so. Could very easily have finished off another order. Not far behind was the Cod. Nicely cooked, it was soft and had the mouth melting texture you want from seafood. It was extremely good. The sashimi was good and solid as well, with the pieces of salmon and tuna nice and fresh and other accompanying pieces ranging from octopus to mackerel. The dessert rounded out the meal very nicely. After the meal, we all had that nice feeling of being very satisfied but not sickly stuffed.I really enjoyed my time at Morimoto and would love to come back for a full dinner here in the future.So excited we finally made it to Morimoto! And this was restaurant week so our timing couldn\\'t have been better. We were there for lunch. I had the sushi lunch and hubby had the sashimi lunch, each came with salad, pickled cucumbers, green beans, miso soup and dessert was also delicious, I can\\'t remember the names, the citrus one was so good!Crazy expensive but the poke bowl was amazing and I had a little more of a third left for lunch the next day. House made soy sauce is also amazing! Everybody in the group loved the food.This review is only based on the restaurant week menu. ?Let\\'s just say I left there still hungry because the portions were so small. I had the sushi as maki and the quality of the sushi was just okay. ?I wasn\\'t impressed with the fish or the rice which was a bit too firm. ?I\\'ve definitely had better quality sushi at mid priced restaurants in Manhattan.The black braised cod is really delicate. The edge of each petal of the cod is burnt but the inner is soft.The beef is similar, the edge is burnt but the inner is soft. And the sauce is amazing.The dessert is better! Sobs Hana is like pudding with special taste and Shiro Choko is with seasame white chocolate, strong mango ice and special seasame milk biscuit.Really love it!Like the atmosphere and service. Of course, the foods!!! Toro tartere tastes greats has varies dips (see picture). ?Rock shrimp rocks!! came with 2 diff flavors sweet and light chilli and mayo combination. Sashimi all fresh. ?Though I ordered Uni and fatty tuna kind of overpriced as marked m.price but, hey its worth eating. Overall great and friendly and great foods.It\\'s disappointing that I\\'m giving this place a 2 star review because I was so excited to come here for restaurant week. I heard great things about Morimoto and wanted to see what all the hype was about. Unfortunately, my experience here was pretty poor.I came here for restaurant week lunch and I think the worst part of the meal was the service. The food we got was decent (nothing too special) - I wound up getting the 10 pc sashimi and the shiro choko dessert - but the service was really poor. First of all, we waited an hour for our sashimi dish which was absolutely unacceptable. We allotted a good amount of time (1.5 hours) for the meal which has been a perfect amount of time for every other restaurant week where there are three courses (this one only has two because the sides come with the main), but we nearly missed a meeting afterwards because of this delay. Nobody really came to check in on us throughout the meal either - I had to ask for water numerous times and check on our food several times as well.If the service were better, I\\'d probably give Morimoto a 3 or 3.5 because it\\'s definitely not worth the price normally, but the service was extremely subpar so unfortunately I think a 2 star rating is warranted here.What a letdown. I went for restaurant week lunch and honestly the service was an abomination. The food was mediocre. I had the short rib it was ok at best.. expect to walk out hungry as the portion was small. The meat was literally one slice of short rib the size of half my palm. However, if your food is just \"ok\" at least perfect your service. Our server was rude to the table next to us- granted they were two young girls that might have been a little annoying but it made me uncomfortable to sit there and watch the server treat them the way they were treated- those two girls were shocked by how they were treated as well. I was also served two of the same desserts when I ordered the Soba Hana and the Choko but were given two Choko. I told this to the food runner who brought them out and asked him to take back one since it was incorrect but he refused and said to keep both and he would bring the correct one--- it never happened. Instead I was given my check and rushed out. I just laughed at the situation as I didn\\'t even feel like arguing or bringing it to anyone\\'s attention after witnessing the awkward service next to my table. I get it, restaurant week so you have to turn more tables to make a profit but if you are planning to do it so terribly, then don\\'t participate in it.Went there recently for a bday. Ten stars for atmosphere and service! What an incredible place. The wagu beef cooked on the stone and flaming ball chocolate desert was a treat. My seafood yaki was delish with lobster tail, crab claw and mussels. I wish they were a little less expensive! My party of 3 shared one appetizers, each had one entree and shared two deserts for a whopping bill of 400 dollars!!!... and we did not even order alcoholic drinks! Worst part, we were still hungry after because the portions are small. Overall a great food experience though!I book a table but I still wait for around 20min. Really crowded and noisy. The food is average and service not outstanding.Amazing experience! the food is absolutely the best. Service was so AMAZING .We ordered the delicious duck, the tuna pizza and Miso cod!!!This is probably one of my favorite places to go for sushi. This is for those days when you want to splurge a little more on lunch. [Restaurant Week set] We ordered sashimi combo and beef short rib. The sashimi quality is so good, as if they melt in your mouth. The rib is also delicious, but the portion is quite small. For dessert we had shiro choko and soba hana. If you do not like the raw wheat taste, soba hana might taste weird to you. As for shiro choko, the sourness of the sorbet and the sweetness of sesame chocolate creates an interesting balance. I would give the overall taste, quality, and presentation of the food 4.5 stars.[Service] We booked in advance for a weekday lunch, but still waited for 5-10 minutes. The waiter was nice and friendly, don\\'t bother you too much. Good place for a casual work lunch.Absolute favorite sushi spot in NYC. Toro Tartare taste just as great as it looks! Other must haves at Morimoto:- The miso soup is the best, it\\'s also really really big in portion with huge pieces of tofu.- Soft Shell Crab Roll & Toro Scallion (yum!)high probability i might be here every other day just for the rock shrimp. you think i am joking....! also, the hamachi is a fun + delish dish! try both! compliments to the architect/design team as well.Fantastic environment! The inside decoration is pretty good and it was quiet at lunchtime on a weekday as there were just a few people at this time. ?Services were very nice. Waiters were polite and ready for your order at any time. We (2 people) ordered a sashimi set and the hot stone wagyu which we can cook the beef by ourselves. There were 10 pieces of sashimi with 2 pics of each type. The meat of the sashimi is very fresh and delicious. The hot stone wagyu is special and the beef tastes good. The only problem is the stone is not hot enough after a while, so we may need to spend a little more time to heat it and the scene is not so amazing. We also order the Nama tofu as our dessert. The taste is very soft, like the combination of cheesecake and tofu, but it tastes more like the former one, although it is made of tofu. With the chocolate sauce at the bottom, the taste of this dessert is perfect. It is impressive because of its Asian ingredients and western flavor.The price of the weekday lunch is not too expensive and it is worthy to have a lunch in weekdays for such fantastic experience and taste!Okay so overall the food was pretty good, very nice restaurant as well. The service was good the only thing that kinda turned me off was they have 2 menu\\'s one for the day & one at night There was a few things I wanted to try on the \"day menu\" but blah, over all everything was pretty goodThis is very nice restaurant. The people are amazing and the ambiance is great and calm. When walking in it\\'s sorta dark but give you relax feel. There is certain pics on yelp that they don\\'t have after a certain time or they just changed up by the chief. The food was great. Very tasty and good.I\\'ve never left a review in my life about a restaurant but I am just so compelled to give this review because this restaurant was so bad. Hands down the worst restaurant experience I\\'ve ever had in my life. Came here last night 2/14 for Valentine\\'s Day with my girlfriend. First off, the most important part, THE FOOD. The sushi is nothing special at all. I\\'ve been to a few high end sushi restaurants and this doesn\\'t even come close to high end sushi. It was completely average and for the price you\\'re paying, you don\\'t deserve average here. If you want amazing sushi go to Sushi Yasuda. That is on a whole other level than this place. Not as nice of a place but food wise, it is the best sushi in New York.Second, the service. 9PM reservation which I booked 1 month ago. Had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. Sat down at 9:30PM in probably what was the worst table in the restaurant. We were put in a corner where the decor wasn\\'t even close to being ok. It felt like a janitor\\'s closet and mind you, me and my girlfriend are not ugly people. I\\'m 6\\'2 and she\\'s 5\\'10 and models. I had to complain to the hostess to seat us someplace else and he finally obliged and sat us at a good table. Everything seemed good. The decor is beautiful, the table was great now. We ordered the food. Our waiter forgot to tell us that there is WASABI in every piece of sushi. My girlfriend hates Wasabi. This would have been great to know before we ordered and again I\\'ve been to high end sushi restaurants in New York before and not one place has done this. Again I had to fight the staff and talked to the manager who took back the sushi and took out the wasabi. They looked at us like we were dimwits who had no idea about good food or service but I take my girlfriend out to the best restaurants in the city and this was by far the worst one I\\'ve been too. I spent $200 for sushi that was just average, service that sucked, and an annoying, douchey, loud crowd filled with even more annoying loud music played on the speakers that were probably on the worst 100 list. 1 star is generous. Don\\'t go here unless you want to feel like shit afterGot food poisoned on Valentine\\'s Day. Ordered Omakase, Oyster Foie Gras, and Duck Confit. Omakase was very different in what I would expect. I did not like many of the omakase dishes. After dinner, my girlfriend got severe stomache and needed to vomit as well. Morimoto, please prepare fresh food....I didn\\'t see what the hype is. I feel like it\\'s a average, and over priced place. I tried the tuna tartare and it was ok, for main dish I had salmon dish and it really wasn\\'t good.Very elegant and fancy japanese restaurant with beautiful and unique one of a kind decors. My server is so wonderful and smile all the way even though we came at their break time. I didnt catch her name. I gave 4 stars becuase the quality of the food is not what I expected, small and bland taste. Maybe because we went on Restaurant Lunch Week. Overall, it was a very nice experience with my niece and mother for girls gathering lunch...We tried the restaurant week menu. Cod was extremely outstanding and I would highly recommend that! Sashimi was good too, but I would go to the market for the similar quality but cheaper prices. Overall good dining experience.All of these people who are not impressed with the sushi here and state they have had better elsewhere...please share those places! :) I need to go because I thought the sushi here was absolutely delicious and ate so slowly, savoring every bite.I originally booked for Restaurant Week, but didn\\'t like the options available so I ordered from the regular lunch menu. I enjoyed the eel roll, california roll and salmon nigiri. The kigo cocktail was yummy, fruity without being too sweet. I also had a glass of their rose which I did not regret one bit!Service was friendly and of course, the interior of the restaurant is beautiful. Do not forget to visit the restroom before you leave. The toilets need an operator\\'s manual, but it was quite the experience for a plebian such as myself.Very good Japanese cuisine in a modernistic cool space by Chelsea market. Even though it looks like it\\'s a part of Chelsea market on the map, it\\'s a separate restaurant on 10th av.Came here for restaurant week during lunch. Service was fast even though they were busy. Got blackened cod along with the chocolate dessert.The cod was amazingly done and was perfect and was ready to eat many more plates of the same. I didn\\'t get to try the sushi but it looked pretty good as well. All the meals come with miso soup, salad on a tray.The chocolate dessert was amazing as well and is a must try. Overall it was a very good experience, and a good place to try if you\\'re in the area. 4 stars only bcoz I didn\\'t get to try their other dishes. Ps there\\'s nothing special about the bathrooms :)The food is out of this world. So delicious, so fresh, so different. Great, friendly service as well. The restaurant itself is quite beautiful, make sure you use the restroom if you\\'re visiting for the first time.4 stars for the service and the decor. The food was mediocre and quite underwhelming at times. Skip this and go to Sushi Yasuda instead. You\\'ll get more bang for your buck there.Hands down one of the best restaurant i been to, the restaurant is super sleek and modern. I order the following: 1. Kumamato Oysters- the best oyster i ever had it was light, sweet, mild brininess and very delicious. 2.Toro tartare- melts in your mouth like butter, i love the combination of all the condiments 3. Beef Carpaccio - one of my favorite appetizer i have to get this every time I\\'m here 4. Miso glazed roasted bone marrow- ?didn\\'t like it taste like a mouth full of fat5. Chefs selection sashimi and uni - it was so fresh6. Wagyu A5- melts in you mouth! that\\'s all i can say 7. Duck, Duck, Duck- the portion wasn\\'t much not so crazy about ?8. Seafood Toban Yaki - wasn\\'t a fan of didn\\'t like the taste of itI could eat here 10 times a week. Incredible quality and inventive flavors. Clean and beautiful. Really is a treat for the soul.This is my second time here, again for a RW lunch to celebrate my niece\\'s birthday and Chinese New Year.Our group ordered the following from RW menu:- sashimi (fresh)- sushi- Morimoto Burger (A. preferred the one from Shake Shack)- 5 spice pork belly don (my mom loved it and ate the whole thing)We also ordered toro tartare ($30) again - it is okFor dessert, we tried both desserts (chocolate cake and pot de creme) from RW menu and both were good.For my niece\\'s birthday, we ordered fiery chocolate tart ($21) and this was our highlight of the day. ?Love this dessert.Ordered Jasmine tea ($6) and it was very good tea.My only complaint was the sangria ($9) which was a small portion with lot of ice and it was one of the worst sangria I had. ?Service was great!Excellent experience, we ordered morimoto omakase - chefs recommended menu. Each item on the dish was a piece of art! Desserts were simply fabulousWinter 2017 Restaurant Week Lunch ReviewAs the others have mentioned, everything here is clean. modern, and beautiful. Service was amazing and the respect they give to their patron are as close as eating in Japan.My problem lies with the Resturant week menu only. If you are reading this, no need to skip to the end- just avoid this selection of the menu. Choose from their wonderful regular menu and prevent disappointment.Perhaps it was my fault for booking lunch here for the Winter Restaurant Week in hopes for a great tasting menu, and was shocked there was none for the lunch menu. Just a lunch entree, that included a dessert, and some Resturant week inspired cocktails that anyone dining could order.Each lunch entree came with the following:Miso soup- which is same original taste as Japan. Good, but quite standard with a fresh, soft piece of decadent tofu at the bottom. Salad- which was wilted perfect for a soft bite dresses with very good, refreshing ponzu sauce that was sweet to the taste. Simplicity at its best.Raw Green beans- served cold bursting of earthy and fresh flavors. It was a very strong and unadulterated Uncooked flavor that I really loved!Gomaae Pickled Cucumber- very nice sesame and spice with a crisp slice of pickled cucumber Entree- Sushi Combo:Standard proper sushi. Rich was proper, flavorful, and spot on with the texture and hardness. Hamachi (yellowtail)- fresh. Sake (salmon)- fresh and melting in your mouth. Tai (red snapper)- fresh. Seared tuna- fresh and flavorful. Ebi (cooked shrimp)- fresh but very very boring. The Maki was a Tuna roll that was ?absolutely amazing! It had a kick of spicy and a earthly blend of flavors that I could not identify. Gari (Ginger) was so nice and the tone of potency was leveled down perfect. Came with fresh wasabi root that was not overwhelming. Entree- 5 Spice Pork Belly:Pork belly taste was a bit different and unexpected. It was a bit too sweet with an extreme \"raw-pork\" flavor. The rice was cooked perfect, yet the tamago was too hard and overcooked. The whole dish felt just mass produced and left a greasy pork-flavored film in the mouth with each bite. It wasn\\'t horrible, however, I guess my expectations were too high for the Iron Chef\\'s Resturant. Verdict: ???Course Dessert: Chocolate Fondant vs Pot De CremeCake was horribly dry and service with a boring scoop of coffee ice cream. Pot de Creme was quite generic, however with a rather nice apricot-Carmel sauce and sesame flake.Verdict: pot de creme On the other hand, the Cocktail was a huge hit! Tokorozawa was a beautiful blend of chamomile infused applejack, pineau de charentes, Fuji apple pervaded honey and demonstrated the epitome of a tasting of the the Chefs skill. The real question iss, who really got this on the menu? There was only a hint of honey with a citrus burst of strong alcohol in each sip. That with the garnish of a charred lemon peal made it easy to drink and wanting more. I only wish it was actually served hot, instead of lukewarm. All in all, everything was fresh with quality ingredient, however, nothing about the food really blew me away. The portions were tiny, which included the short pour cocktail (the Star of the whole experience). Again, waitstaff was very kind and the inside is a beautiful modern restaurant. However, I feel the focus was not in the Resturant Week Menu and I truely expected more.just the food with reasonable price , would give it 4.5star. it is really just ok. went there mainly to experience the restaurant by tado ando incase anyone doesn\\'t know .Came here for restaurant week and we order the five spice pork and dry aged burger. The set comes with side dishes. We got green bean, marinated cucumber and miso soup. The side dish were alright not that good. The dry aged burger was cook to medium. It good but the burger is smaller than a normal size burger. The pork belly was chewy and you only get two little pieces on top of a small bowl of rice along with half egg and yellow raffish. Nothing special about it. I don\\'t think I would come back. For the amount you pay I can definitely get better food. recommended if u never been and just want to experience and say you been there.AMAZINGGGG as if you didn\\'t already know from the over two thousand reviews that have been written about this place. We sat at the long sushi bar, but on the platform, which was a little awkward for me personally as the servers constantly had to bend over. Restaurant week lunch menu was delish. I had the sashimi selection. Yum!Went for restaurant week menu, better (even exciting) choice of desserts than main courses; although braised cod is still above the average in that price range. The greatest part might also be the decorations and designing for the space, but a little bit too noisy to have a tender talk between friends.This was the worst restaurant experience of my life. Like holy crap, the food was terrible. It was so bad I canceled the rest of my orders and asked for the check to minimize my loss. The toro tartare was awful. It tasted very fishy, showing its low quality, yet was $30 for maybe 12 square inches. Even if it tasted amazing it would have been a rip off since not even ichimura would charge that much. But it didn\\'t taste amazing, it was horrifically bad. I didn\\'t even finish it (and it was tiny!)Morimoto\\'s attention to detail and desire to be good is non-existent. As an example, I went to the bathroom and the electronic aspect of the toilet didn\\'t work. Upstairs you can see that they primed a wall but never painted it so its discolored. What does this have to do with anything? It shows that they are happy to charge rip-off prices but have no desire to provide the experience that goes with that. Just complete apathy and why not when they get away with ripping off customers who are unfortunate enough to go to a restaurant 5 years too late than when they should have. They are just running on their reputation trying to price gouge as many unsuspecting people as they can. Simply shameful. For those that care, service was good but when the food is awful and provides the worst value i have ever seen, who cares about the service? I\\'m going to contact my credit card company and see if I can get a chargeback on some of the money. The more I think about this experience, the more I feel sad like i was robbed.Exterior and interior design is beautiful. Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is great. Food - nothing too special in part perhaps even disappointing. I came here during restaurant week and ordered the \"angry chicken\", I took two bites and that was it. The part of the chicken chosen for the recipe was just not right in the first place - OK let\\'s try it with the sauce - things just escalated - that was the end of the chicken. The sauce was all wrong for it, it should have been more delicate, taming maybe, instead it tasted like a fried salsa with a yogurt kick. It was abrasive, it was something not meant for this dish entirely. It felt like I stepped into one restaurant to have the chicken and into another to have the sauce, and both terrible. Miso soup was good, dessert was good (sesame pastry on top of creme) but perhaps in too large of a portion to savor it\\'s delicacy, almost drowning by the time you are finished. Disappointed to say the least.'"
